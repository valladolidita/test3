          <p>It is up to each and every individual to help slow down the process of global warming. You need to arm yourself with knowledge in order to combat this problem. You need to do your own homework to help familiarize yourself with the facts. There is a lot of information available to help you understand this process and your role in it.</p>

          <h1>Save Energy</h1>
           <p>Appliances in our homes are using electricity and emitting carbon even when they are not in use. If you simply unplug them at night or when you are at work, this is a great small step you can take that will not cost you a penny. It will in fact save you on your electricity consumption.</p>

          <p>Environmental changes are happening and it is up to each and every individual to do something about it. If we all do our part we can significantly make a difference in our future. It doesnâ€™t take a lot of time or money and almost anyone can make small changes.</p>

          <h1>Plant a Tree</h1>
          <p>Planting trees and shrubs around your home can help keep your home cool in the summer. Trees and shrubs also absorb carbon monoxide and this can help the air you breathe and your environment. There are many types of greenery to choose from and you can find something that will fit your taste.</p>
